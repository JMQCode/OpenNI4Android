OpenNI4Android
==============
 __At this moment this template only contains binaries for Android X86. I will add ARM binaries soon.__
 
Did you try to develop an Android app using OpenNI? If you answer is YES You know the pain youÂ´ve encountered during the process.
I found this [tutorial](http://www.hirotakaster.com/archives/2012/01/how-to-build-openni-android-application.php) which is great but
you can see with your own eyes dozens of comments with a lot of problems. A lot of them are related with linux stuff like problems with USBFS, usb not reachable due to
permissions... but There are some of them related with Eclipse, because that structure of referenced projects and jar library is madness. And even I could execute my apks I always
got errors of missing apks in console. So I decided to simplify the structure and now there is just one project with all you need inside it.
Enjoy it.
